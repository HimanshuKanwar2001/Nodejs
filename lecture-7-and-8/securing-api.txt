        Securing Application

        why do we secure app ?                  -How do we secure apps?
        -for controlled access                  -Verify who user is
        -Data Privacy                           -Verify what users can access


        Authentication
        -Verifying user's Indentity.
        -COnfirms that a user is who they claim to be.
        -Examples include verify credentials tokens

        Authorization
        -Granting or denying access to specific resources based on user's privileges
        -Controls access to resources based on the user's privileges.
        -Examples include checking if the authenticated user has the permissions o access a resource.



        Types of Authentication

        1.Basic Authentication
        -Requeries user's credentials on each request .

        2.API Keys
        -API Keys are provided by signing up users on developer portals.

        3.OAuth
        -Third-part app integration

        4.JWT
        -Creates a resuable token with option to refresh.



        Problems with Basic Authentication
        -No encryption,hence not very secure.(it is encoded);
        -Client needs to store credentials,which can be exposed
        -Easy to crack using Brute-Force attacks.


        JSon WEb token
        -Encrypted token
        -Stateless
        -Easy to Scale
        -Can be used by Mobile and Web both

        Structure
        -Header.Payload.Signature


        client                                          Server
                    1.Login with credentials----->          2.creates a JWT token
            <-------3.sends token to client
                    4.Sendws token in Authorization header--->  5.verfiy JWT token,access client info
            <-------6.Send response to client
