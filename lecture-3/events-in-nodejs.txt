what are events?
1. a click of button
2. a change in data
3. a change in file

eg. update DB ,feed update,Timeline

THE DATA WE RECEIVES FROM THE CLIENT IS IN FORM OF MULTIPLE CHUNKS WE DO NOT RECEIVES ALL AT ONCE


Nodejs built-in events
"data": Triggered when a readable stream receives new data
"error": Fired when an error occurs in the applications
"listening": Emitted when a server starts listening for incoming connections.

using events to read data on post request


Advantages of Event-Driven Architecture

1. Scalability
2. Loose coupling(creating different features in different files to make it scalable in future, when the modules dont know about each other and still work with each other)
3. Better Responsiveness


Best Practices

1.Modularize your code:
2.User descritive naming conventions
3.Keep module responsibilites clear(SOC/SRP)
3.Use version control like git
